Micro Explainer
---------------
Trying to explain m-swale-story
which has the anomaly:
  :instance isa m-event-sequence-conflict
  :event-sequence: m-racehorse-life
  :expectation: m-expectation-1
  :surprising-fact: m-swale-dead-state


Micro XP Retriever
------------------
Searching for XP's.
... found m-die-from-illness-xp, m-die-from-old-age-xp.
Applying m-die-from-illness-xp.
... generated M-EXPL0.
Applying m-die-from-old-age-xp.
... generated M-EXPL1.


Micro-Accepter
--------------
Evaluating M-EXPL0 for the purpose prediction.
The underling XP is
  :mop isa m-xp
  :events: ((:illness m-bad-health-state) (:outcome m-dead-state))
  :causals: ((:illness => :outcome))
  :constraints: (((:events :illness :object) (:events :outcome :object)))
Checking if explanation accounts for m-swale-dead-state.
... appears relevant.
Checking believability.
Problem found!
  :instance isa m-non-normative-filler-problem
  :explanation: M-EXPL0
  :path: (:events :illness :object)
  :expected-value: m-unhealthy-animal
  :observed-value: m-swale
... explanation is not believable.
Checking if explanation is useful for the purpose prediction.
Is the explanation predictive?
... Explanation is adequate for prediction.
Checking seriousness of problems.
... M-EXPL0 is tweakable.

Micro XP Retriever
------------------
Searching for XP's.
